We will use data from the 2019–2024 seasons. Our input data will include information about the drivers, constructors, and the engine used by each team. The goal of this analysis is to understand and predict how various factors, such as driver skills, team changes, and engine suppliers, influence driver performance over multiple seasons. This model could help teams make strategic decisions, such as whether changing a driver or engine supplier might improve performance. It could also be useful for fans and analysts to assess the impact of technical and human factors on results.",
